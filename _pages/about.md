Currently, I'm a third-year PhD student in the [Bits to Energy Lab](https://www.bitstoenergy.com) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.im.ethz.ch). In my current research, I develop machine learning techniques for energy applications to promote sustainability and for the digitalization of the power grid. 🔋🔌💡 One area of focus for my work is analyzing data from smart electricity meters to optimize residential heat pumps in operation. For my research, I currently collaborate with multiple partners: [Swiss Federal Office of Energy](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/de/home.html), [Bosch](https://www.bosch-homecomfort.com/ch/de/wohngebaeude/home/), [EKZ](https://www.ekz.ch/de/privatkunden.html), [BEN Energy](https://www.ben-energy.com/), and [Hoval](https://www.hoval.ch/).

I hold a master’s degree from [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1) (M.Sc. Electrical Engineering, Information Technology & Computer Engineering) and two bachelor’s degrees from the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) (B.Sc. Electrical Engineering & Information Technology // B. Sc. Industrial Engineering & Business Administration). Previously, I was a visiting researcher at [Yale University](https://krishnaswamylab.org), founded a startup in the area of augmented reality and have worked for and with multiple companies (e.g., GoogleAI, Mercedes Benz, SAP, and Merck).
