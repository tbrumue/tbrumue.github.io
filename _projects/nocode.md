I worked as product owner in a team in the New Ventures & Technologies / Cloud Platform division at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/) that develops software to digitize teamwork and automate the long-tail of business processes without code. The team formerly developed a product called [SAP Ruum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsyTqnW0D-U) which now is part of the [SAP Build Process Automation](https://www.sap.com/germany/products/technology-platform/process-automation.html) platform.
