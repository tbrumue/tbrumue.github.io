As a visiting researcher at the [Krishnaswamy Lab](https://krishnaswamylab.org) at **Yale University** and in close collaboration with researchers from **Google AI** and the **University of California, Berkeley**, I worked on combining deep learning algorithms and logic circuits for biomedical data analysis. As part of the project, I developed a novel logic learning pipeline that makes predictions more interpretable and reduces hardware costs. This is beneficial in the context of patient care to enable risk stratification and clinical decision making.
