Together with two colleagues, I founded a start-up in the field of augmented reality named **monocular UG (haftungsbeschr√§nkt)**, for which I worked as CEO and software developer. We mainly developed software that helps company sales representatives to present complex products to their customers in an interactive manner. Our customers included [Merck Group](https://www.merckgroup.com/en) and [Neuland & Herzer Agency](https://www.neulandherzer.com/en/). The details of our customers' projects unfortunately cannot be disclosed, but below you can find some showcase videos of other demo projects from early days:
