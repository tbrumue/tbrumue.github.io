As a PhD candidate in the [Bits to Energy Lab](https://www.bitstoenergy.com) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.im.ethz.ch), I develop machine learning techniques for energy applications to promote sustainability and for the digitalization of the power grid. In particular, my work focuses on analyzing data from smart electricity meters. 

In mid of 2023, my colleague [Markus Kreft](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-3GGQI92D4QC&hl) and I published a [hands-on Python tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bitstoenergy/iclr-tutorial/blob/main/SmartMeterDataAnalytics_Tutorial.ipynb) on smart meter data analytics at the **International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023)** as part of the *Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning*. Further, [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai) featured the tutorial in the program of their 2023 summer school with more than 6000 virtual participants around the globe.
