At the [Institute of Imaging and Computer Vision at RWTH Aachen University](https://www.lfb.rwth-aachen.de/en/), I worked on neural network architectures, machine learning algorithms, and data augmentation techniques for medical image understanding in hematology. The project, which was supervised by [Philipp Gr√§bel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6KgK6aUAAAAJ&hl), focused on semantic segmentation, detection, and classification of bone marrow leukocytes on images of stained bone marrow.
